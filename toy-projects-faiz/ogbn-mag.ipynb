    "**Graph:** The ogbn-mag dataset is a heterogeneous network composed of a **subset** of the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) [1]. It contains four types of **entities—papers** (736,389 nodes), **authors** (1,134,649 nodes), **institutions** (8,740 nodes), and **fields of study** (59,965 nodes)—as well as four types of directed relations connecting two types of entities—an author is “affiliated with” an institution, an author “writes” a paper, a paper “cites” a paper, and a paper “has a topic of” a field of study. Similar to ogbn-arxiv, each paper is associated with a 128-dimensional word2vec feature vector, and all the other types of entities are not associated with input node features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction task:** Given the heterogeneous ogbn-mag data, the task is to predict the **venue**(conference or journal) of each paper, given its content, references, authors, and authors’ affiliations. This is of practical interest as some manuscripts’ venue information is unknown or missing in MAG, due to the noisy nature of Web data. In total, there are 349 different venues in ogbn-mag, making the task a 349-class classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset splitting:** We follow the same time-based strategy as ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-papers100M to split the paper nodes in the heterogeneous graph, i.e., training models to predict venue labels of all papers published before 2018, validating and testing the models on papers published in 2018 and since 2019, respectively."
